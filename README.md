# Adaptable Game-based, Interactive Learning Environments for STEM Education (AGILE STEM) 

This is a National Science Foundation’s (NSF’s) Research on Emerging Technologies for Teaching and Learning (RETTL)  supported project (NSF-2302815) in collaboration with Penn State University and Carnegie Mellon University.

The project focuses on model-based systems and production engineering (MBSPE) STEM discipline for (two-year and four-year) undergraduate students and graduate students in online and residential settings. The project activities will advance the knowledge of emerging technology-based learning environments by iteratively designing, developing, testing, deploying, and assessing 3D simulated game-based learning environments we call Adaptable Game-based, Interactive Learning Environments for STEM Education (AGILE STEM). The AGILE STEM learning environments will immerse the learners in complex three-dimensional (3D) simulated games with customizable and adaptive content according to the learner’s characteristics, self-regulated skills, and performance. The narratives and simulation models are inspired by real-world systems. The simulated game-based environments will enhance students’ understanding of complex systems concepts that are challenging to understand using traditional teaching approaches and will help build the much-needed skills for the US engineering workforce. The proposed emerging technologies do not necessarily need access to specialized equipment which eliminates barriers to scalability and border implementation and use. In addition, the project team is connected with an industry consultant and game design expert who will help create reality-inspired AGILE STEM learning environments that are aligned with industry needs as well as privacy issues and policies.
